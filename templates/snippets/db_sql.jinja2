### Database (SQL)
- Symptoms: “too many clients”, connection timeouts, spike in `DatabaseConnections`.
- Actions: enable/verify pooling (pgBouncer/ProxySQL); set pool sizes per replica.
- ORM: limit max connections, set timeouts, retries with backoff+jitter.
- Param hints: derive `max_connections` from instance class; monitor `FreeableMemory`.
