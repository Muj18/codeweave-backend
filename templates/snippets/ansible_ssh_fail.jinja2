### Ansible SSH Failure Troubleshooting

**Key Symptoms**
- Playbook fails with `UNREACHABLE!` or `Permission denied (publickey)`
- Long SSH timeouts during task execution
- Connection refused or host unreachable
- Works manually via `ssh`, but fails via Ansible

**Immediate Triage**
- Verify inventory file has correct host/IP and user
- Test SSH manually: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/key user@host`
- Check that target hostâ€™s SSHD is running and accessible
- Confirm correct private key is configured in `ansible.cfg`
- Ensure `become` and sudo permissions are valid

**Safe Fix**
```yaml
# Example inventory with explicit SSH user/key
[webservers]
192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
