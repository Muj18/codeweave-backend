### Object Storage (S3/GCS/Blob) â€” Pro SRE Hands-On

Quick Access Tests
- aws s3 ls s3://<bucket>                      # Verify basic access
- aws s3 cp /tmp/test.txt s3://<bucket>/test   # Put/Get sanity

Permissions & Policy
- Check bucket policy and IAM principal perms (GetObject/PutObject/ListBucket).
- Validate CORS rules if browser traffic is involved; fix 403/AccessDenied.

Networking / Pathing
- Ensure correct region and endpoint; verify VPC endpoints/NAT egress for private subnets.
- If using presigned URLs, confirm expiry/TTL and system clock sync.

Safety
- Server-side encryption on; block public access unless explicitly required.
- Lifecycle rules for cost control and retention guarantees.
