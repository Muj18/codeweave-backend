### Observability (Metrics/Logs/Traces) â€” Pro SRE Hands-On

Prometheus / Metrics
- curl -s http://<prometheus>/api/v1/query?query=up    # quick sanity
- For pod CPU: rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])
- If kubectl top is missing, (re)install metrics-server and check RBAC.

Grafana / Dashboards
- Verify dashboards for: RPS, p95/p99 latency, error rate, restarts, DB connections, consumer lag.
- Ensure panel queries and data sources are healthy; check alert rules firing as expected.

Tracing / APM
- Ensure stable service names, critical spans, and reasonable sampling.
- Trace a failing request end-to-end to see the slowest/errored component.

Runbooks
- Link dashboards and incident runbooks directly in the report for fast follow-up.
