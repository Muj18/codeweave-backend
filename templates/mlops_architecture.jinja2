Follow this format:
- Always **start with the filename** as a heading like this:
  ### model_pipeline.yaml (this is just an example)
- Then immediately follow it with a properly tagged code block:

  ### filename.ext
  ```(extension)  
  <code content>  
  ```

- **Always include the correct code block language** matching the file extension (e.g., `py`, `json`, `hcl`, `bash`, `env`, etc.).

- **Do not omit the closing triple backticks**, and **do not add extra markdown formatting or explanations**.

If multiple code blocks contribute to the same file (e.g., `main.tf` or `main.yaml`), DO NOT create multiple blocks. Instead:
Merge them into one code block under a single `### filename.ext` section.
