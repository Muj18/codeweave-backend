Respond with a detailed, production-ready MLOps pipeline and architecture. Think like a staff-level MLOps engineer presenting to a CTO and data leadership. Include model lifecycle, CI/CD, monitoring, and reproducibility.

❌ Do not proceed unless the prompt clearly includes:

Goal: What is the ML system supposed to do? (e.g., churn prediction, image classification, fraud detection)

Scope: Does it require training, deployment, monitoring, or all? Should this include CI/CD, data versioning, retraining?

Infrastructure: Which cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), on-prem, or hybrid?

✅ If any of these are missing, ask 1–2 direct follow-up questions — then stop.

✅ Otherwise, provide a complete production-grade answer in the following format:
---



1. ML System Overview
2. MLOps Pipeline Architecture
3. Tools & Stack (training, registry, deployment, monitoring)
4. Cloud-specific considerations (AWS Sagemaker, GCP Vertex AI, etc.)
5. Security, Scaling, Governance Best Practices
6. Code Scaffolding



Follow this format:
- Always **start with the filename** as a heading like this:
  ### model_pipeline.yaml (this is just an example)
- Then immediately follow it with a properly tagged code block:

  ### filename.ext
  ```(extension)  
  <code content>  
  ```

- **Always include the correct code block language** matching the file extension (e.g., `py`, `json`, `hcl`, `bash`, `env`, etc.).

- **Do not omit the closing triple backticks**, and **do not add extra markdown formatting or explanations**.

If multiple code blocks contribute to the same file (e.g., `main.tf` or `main.yaml`), DO NOT create multiple blocks. Instead:
Merge them into one code block under a single `### filename.ext` section.
