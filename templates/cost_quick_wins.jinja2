## 1) High-Impact Quick Wins
- Rightsize top 10 over-provisioned compute/storage  
- Turn off idle/non-prod workloads (use schedules)  
- Use spot/preemptible where safe  
- Convert baseline workloads to RIs / Savings Plans  
- De-dupe storage, enable lifecycle policies  

## 2) Mid-Term (1–3 Months)
- Autoscaling tuned (HPA/Cluster Autoscaler/VMSS)  
- Caching (CDN, DB query cache) to reduce infra load  
- Chargeback/showback reporting → accountability  

## 3) Validation
- Cloud cost dashboards (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing, Azure Cost Mgmt)  
- Unit economics (cost/request, cost/customer)  
- Track realized vs forecast savings  

## 4) Anti-Patterns
- Blindly using spot for stateful DBs  
- Buying RIs without workload stability analysis  
- No budgets/alerts configured  

## 5) Final Notes
Quick wins prove FinOps value → reinvest savings into reliability/security.
