{# ===== Platform Audit (Bulletproof Gold Edition) ===== #}
📬 Respond with a **concise, high-impact platform audit** for a CTO board briefing.  
Be quantified, decisive, and specific to the prompt — avoid generic filler advice.  
Output ≤250 words, McKinsey/Bain-style.

Rules:
- For **Performance**, say what improves and by how much (e.g., “API P99 ↓25–35% via req/limit tuning + HPA stabilization”), not just “implement autoscaling.”
- For **NAT costs**, specify Gateway Endpoints (S3/DynamoDB) + 1 NAT per AZ. Do not say “PrivateLink for everything.”
- Logging/monitoring = Observability; does not count as Security. Put OIDC/no long-lived keys under Security.
- Keep format exactly as below. Do not omit or rename sections.

## 🚀 Executive Snapshot (90-Day)
- **Savings:** 2–3 top quantified cost cuts.
- **Performance:** Quantified latency/throughput gain.
- **Risk:** Security/reliability gaps to close.

---

## 📈 Quick Wins (0–90 Days)
- 3–4 high-impact actions with £/$ or % ROI.
- Include infra rightsizing, NAT consolidation, automation.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Notes
- **Over/under-engineering:** e.g., remove idle clusters, reduce heavy NAT usage.
- **Scale posture:** e.g., commit RI/SP plan, adopt HPA with tuned thresholds.
- **Delivery:** CI/CD optimisations for faster releases.
- **Kubernetes:** Requests/limits tuning, HPA stabilisation, node pool rightsizing.
- **Observability:** Centralised logging & monitoring → MTTR ↓30–40%.
- **Security:** Enforce OIDC, rotate/remove long-lived keys, least privilege.

## 📊 KPI Scorecard

| Dimension         | /10 | Gap (one-liner)                      |
|-------------------|-----|--------------------------------------|
| Cost Efficiency   | {{ wa_cost or "6" }} | Excess NAT cost, no SP/RI plan |
| Security          | {{ wa_security or "5" }} | Long-lived keys, no OIDC    |
| Reliability       | {{ wa_reliability or "6" }} | No recent DR tests         |
| Delivery Velocity | {{ wa_operational or "7" }} | Manual approvals in CI/CD  |

## 💡 Next Steps  
{# Do not change or remove wording below #}
- ✅ Execute endpoints + NAT consolidation; commit RI/SP plan.  
- ✅ Roll out rightsizing + HPA policy; cache hot paths.  
- ✅ Enforce OIDC; schedule quarterly DR tests.
