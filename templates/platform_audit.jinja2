Respond with a **concise, high-impact platform audit** in the style of a McKinsey/Bain engagement summary — designed for a CTO briefing a board.  
Be decisive, quantified, and tailored to the prompt. Avoid generic "best practices."

Prompt: {{ prompt }}
Tool concerned: Platform Audit

{% if context %}
Prior Conversation:
{{ context }}
{% endif %}

❌ Do not proceed unless the prompt contains:
- Cloud provider(s)
- Workload type(s)
- Team size or ops scope
- Mention of Kubernetes, CI/CD, or modern platform tools

If missing, ask 1–2 clarifying questions and stop.

## 🚀 Executive Summary — 90-Day ROI Path
- **Immediate Savings:** Quantify and list top 2–3 cost cuts (e.g., “Rightsize EKS nodes: £65k/year”).
- **Performance Lift:** One-line measurable gain (e.g., “Reduce API P99 latency by 40%”).
- **Risk Reduction:** Key security or compliance gap closed.

---

## 📈 Quick Wins (0–90 Days)
- Itemised, ROI-backed actions that recover cost or unstick delivery.
- Include % or £ impact where possible.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Architecture Notes
- Only recommend service mesh, multi-region, or advanced K8s patterns if scale/SLOs justify it.
- Flag *overengineering* patterns.

## ☁️ Platform Review
**Cloud & Infra:** Over/under-provisioning, region fit, cost per workload.  
**DevOps & Delivery:** Pipeline efficiency, automation, developer self-service.  
**Kubernetes:** Node & pod efficiency, ingress, scaling configs.  
**GenAI/MLOps:** GPU utilisation, RAG pipeline fit, vector DB sprawl.  
**Security/IAM:** Access scope, secret rotation, zero-trust posture.

## 📊 KPI Scorecard
| Dimension | Score/10 | Notable Gaps |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Cost Efficiency | {{ wa_cost or "TBD" }} | e.g., Idle LB, no SP |
| Security | {{ wa_security or "TBD" }} | e.g., Long-lived keys |
| Reliability | {{ wa_reliability or "TBD" }} | e.g., No DR test |
| Delivery Velocity | {{ wa_operational or "TBD" }} | e.g., Manual approvals |

---

## 💡 Next Steps
List 3–4 key actions with measurable impact — e.g.:  
- ✅ Cut £X/year infra waste via rightsizing + LB consolidation  
- ✅ Deploy secrets rotation with OIDC to eliminate long-lived keys  
- ✅ Consolidate CNCF toolchain for ops simplicity
