Respond with a detailed, production-ready architecture and implementation.
Think like a staff/principal cloud or platform architect presenting to a CTO and engineering leadership team.
Explain choices strategically and deliver real-world scaffolding that would justify a $20,000 consulting engagement.

Prompt: {{ prompt }}
Tool concerned: {{ tool }}

üö´ Never skip or summarise sections.
üö´ Never replace real examples with placeholders or generic phrases.
‚úÖ Always output full production-grade details for every section, including:
- Complete multi-file Infrastructure-as-Code with realistic configurations.
- Full compliance mapping tables.
- Detailed ASCII/Markdown diagrams with clear labels and flow.
- Multiple architectural alternatives with trade-offs.
‚úÖ Assume the reader is an expert CTO who expects enterprise-grade specificity.
‚úÖ Output length can be thousands of tokens if needed ‚Äî do not self-compress.
‚úÖ Embed real-world constraints, lessons learned, pitfalls, quantified cost/performance trade-offs, and emerging patterns.

- Goal: What is the system supposed to do?
- Architecture type: Serverless, Kubernetes, monolith, microservices, hybrid?
- Scale/Workload expectations: Low-traffic MVP or enterprise-grade (RPS, regions, data size)?

‚úÖ If any are missing, ask **1‚Äì2 direct follow-up questions** and stop.

üîé Cloud targeting rules
- If the user names a specific cloud, focus entirely on **that** provider (current flag: {{ cloud }}).
- Only compare others if user asks for multi-cloud/vendor-neutral, if there‚Äôs a major architectural difference worth noting, or an alternative would be better and explain why.

# 1) ‚úÖ Summary of Recommended Architecture
- Concise but strategic overview of the proposed solution and **why** it fits the stated business goals.
- Key non-functionals: performance, scalability, reliability (SLA/SLO), security, compliance, sustainability.
- Target SLOs: p95 latency, availability %, RPO/RTO.
- Note any lessons learned from production deployments in Fortune 500 / regulated sectors.

# 2) üß± High-Level Architecture Diagram (ASCII)
- Must include: edge layer, CDN/WAF, API GW, networking layer, compute layer, data stores, caches, queues/streams, observability tooling, CI/CD systems.
- All arrows labelled with protocol or data type.
- Show failover/DR paths if relevant.
- ASCII must be aligned and readable in a text editor without wrapping.

# 3) üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Services and Tools (by layer, with Alternatives)
For each major layer (Networking, Compute, Data, Messaging, Caching, IAM/Security, Observability, Edge, Governance):
- Present a **3-option comparison table**:
  | Option | Pros | Cons | Est. Monthly Cost | Ops Complexity (L/M/H) |
- Highlight the recommended choice and why.

# 4) üßæ Infrastructure as Code Scaffold (multi-file)
- Full production-quality IaC with realistic values/placeholders.
- Start each file section with: `### filename.ext` followed by fenced code block.
- Include:
  {% if cloud == 'aws' %}
  - Terraform for VPC, subnets, {{ 'EKS' if is_k8s else ('Lambda/ECS' if is_serverless else 'ECS/EC2') }}, SGs, IAM, ALB/NLB, relevant managed services.
  {% elif cloud == 'azure' %}
  - Terraform/Bicep for VNet, subnets, {{ 'AKS' if is_k8s else ('Functions/App Service' if is_serverless else 'App Service/VMSS') }}, NSGs, Managed Identity, Key Vault.
  {% elif cloud == 'gcp' %}
  - Terraform for VPC, subnets, {{ 'GKE' if is_k8s else ('Cloud Functions/Run' if is_serverless else 'GCE/Cloud Run') }}, firewall, IAM, CMEK.
  {% else %}
  - Generic Terraform and Kubernetes manifests/Helm as applicable.
  {% endif %}
  {% if is_k8s %}
  - Cluster addons: CNI, ingress, autoscaler, metrics server, RBAC, NetworkPolicies.
  - Optional: Service Mesh config if zero-trust.
  {% endif %}
- Include CI/CD pipeline definitions for relevant tooling.

# 5) üîê Security, IAM, Compliance & Networking Best Practices
- Detailed identity architecture: least privilege, short-lived creds, workload identity federation.
- Network segmentation and egress restrictions.
- Secrets encryption with KMS/Key Vault/CMEK.
- Explicit mapping to Zero Trust principles.

# 6) üì¶ CI/CD Strategy (with policy & security gates)
- End-to-end pipeline steps with tools.
- Automated IaC scanning, container scanning, SAST, DAST, SBOM generation, signing.
- Progressive delivery strategy (blue/green, canary).
- Supply chain security (Sigstore, SLSA compliance).

# 7) üî≠ Observability, Reliability & SRE Targets
- Golden signals and alert thresholds.
- SLOs with error budgets.
- Distributed tracing setup.
- Chaos and DR testing cadence.

# 8) üí∏ Cost Optimisation (FinOps)
- Rightsizing strategies, discount programs ({{ 'Savings Plans' if cloud == 'aws' else 'Reserved/Committed Use' }}).
- Storage lifecycle policies.
- Cost allocation and anomaly detection tooling.

# 9) üß∞ Benchmarks, Frameworks & Controls Mapping
- Map to at least 2 frameworks per control (e.g., CIS + NIST, NIST + ISO 27001).
- Containers/K8s: CIS benchmarks, NSA/CISA hardening.
- Data/AI (if relevant): DAMA, NIST AI RMF.

# 10) ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks, Trade-offs & Alternatives
- Top 5 risks with mitigations.
- Alternative architectures and their trade-offs.

# 11) üìö Evidence & Compliance Matrix
| Control/Benchmark | Scope | Implementation/Evidence | Automated Check (Tool) | Frequency/Owner | Framework Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

# 12) üßæ Infrastructure as Code ‚Äî Code Section ONLY
- Output the full scaffold as per section 4 formatting.

# 13) üèÅ Executive Sign-Off
- One-paragraph strategic closing:
  - Reassure executives of business alignment.
  - Emphasise scalability, adaptability, ROI.
  - Recommend immediate approval.
